           		<p name = "paragraph">The suggestion of learning the basic of machine code may seem quite surprising to you. Although it is recommended to learn, you
           		can get by in your career in Computer Science without knowing too much about the topic. However, in my experience so far, it is actually an important
           		skills that can help programmers and students with what is happening at a deeper level, allowing you to develop more meaningful code. For example,
           		learning assembly can help you understand when jumps occur and how they effect the efficieny of your code, allowing you to make changes to make your
           		code more efficient.</p>
           		
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">Learning some machine code can allow you to manipulate hardware directly which can prove important in some cases. Also,
           		learning machine code such gives you the most control over your own computer. No other programming language will give your more control than machine code
           		itself. Learning how to control such a meaningful language will help you develop your intuition as a programmer due to your deeper understanding. So,
           		if you are still a student, be sure to take a Computer Architecture class to take advantage of this opportunity.</p>
