           		<p name = "paragraph">Without a doubt, problem solving is an essential skill for programmers to master. Every day you will encounter problems
           		in your code and will require a lot of troubleshooting and intuition when it comes to solving errors. The more you practice your problem solving
           		skills, the more you will develop an eye for all sorts of errors and be able to have a solid idea of what is wrong with your code based on your experience
           		with solving all types of problems.</p>
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">Programmers must master problem solving and learn how to "think outside the box". Although the phrase is cliche, it very
           		much applies to the field. For instance, some problems can be solved with old fashioned solutions, however, there are always new and modern solutions to
           		problems which can solve them much more efficiently in terms of execution time and be more cost-efficient. Learning these modern solutions can help you 
           		improve your problem-solving skills and improve your intution when it comes to detecting problems without the help of a compiler.</p>
