           		problems commonly asked by well-reputable companies, entirely depends on your understanding on Data Structures & Algorithms. In addition, your 
           		problem solving skills is built on how well your understanding on this topic is since most problems will revolves around the subject.</p>
           		
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">Having a good intuition on how to manage, organize, and store data is important in itself. You will be managing data
           		all the time in Computer Science and having enough experience to deal with all sorts of data will help you in a meaningful way. Also, having a great
           		understanding of algorithms will just generally make you a better programmer overall. Knowing how certain algorithms work and memorizing a plethora of 
           		algorithms will only help you with your foundational understanding in Computer Science, further improving your programming skills.</p>
