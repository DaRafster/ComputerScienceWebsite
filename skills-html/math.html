           		essential subject you should be strong in to succeed in the field of Computer Science. As you start taking higher level courses in univeristy or 
           		college, you will notice you start to apply your Calculus knowledge and even Discrete Math knowledge to your programs making the courses significantly
           		more difficult.</p>
           		
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">Math is used a lot in the development in algorithms and software that require complex calculuations. For instance,
           		in my Mandelbrot fractal program included in my project page, you will find that I had to deal with complex numbers in order to complete the image.
           		In addition, I had to deal with these complex formulas which I would not have known how to operate without taking Calculus. Sometimes, you can code
           		programs getting away with Math, but since Math is an essential foundation in the Computing Science major, you cannot always get around it.</p>
