           		<p name = "paragraph">Becoming a Software Engineer is undoubtedly what most Computer Science students aspire to be. The salary of a junior software
           		engineer in Canada can go for $70,000 / year. Keep in mind, this is only the salary for a junior engineer. The more experience you get, the higher
           		your salary will increase. In Canada, the average salary of a software engineer ranges between $80,000 - $90,000 depending on the region. Although
           		the salary looks appealing, the job itself is difficult.</p>
           		
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">As a software engineer, you will be required to innovate modern solutions, create applications and will be directed
           		to solve real-world problems. In addition, you will have to apply mathematical principles which in itself is difficult enough. If you aspire to be
           		a software engineer, getting hands on experience will prove to be one of the most important factors. If you are able to get an internship before 
           		graduation, it can set you apart from other people pursuing the career, so it would be a great idea to start looking for one in your second or 
           		third year. </p>
