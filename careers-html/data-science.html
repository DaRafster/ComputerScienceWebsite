           		one of the hardest career paths to get into. Obtaning a job in data science usually requires an "x" amount of years of experience in
           		the field. Usually you would start out in a different occupation and slowly work towards your way towards a data science position. However,
           		if you do land a job, you will be set in the long-term. The average salary of a data scientist starts at $90,000 and goes up from there with
           		experience.</p>
           		
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">The responsibilities of a data science consists of collecting data, analyzing data, and creating real-world 
           		solutions based on data obtained. Although it sounds like as a data scientist you will not need any programming knowledge, this is actually
           		completely false. Knowing programming languages is exteremely important for data scientist to create algorithms that will allow them to solve
           		modern problems. If you are interested in the career choice of data science, it will be difficult to get into the field but will be very rewarding
           		when achieved.</p>
