           		<p name = "paragraph">If you're interested in the topic of cybersecurity, this may be a good beginner project to work on.
           		This project uses the topic of bitwise operators, so getting yourself familiar with bitwise operators before starting this beginner project would be
           		a good idea. First, you must decrypt a word using bitwise operators and a letter from the alphabet. Determining which bitwise operator to use 
           		would be the challenge for you. The list of bitwise operators isn't large, so figuring which one to use shouldn't be too difficult. </p>
           		
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">Next, you would have to decrypt the word using the letter you used in the bitwise operation. How would you do that?
           		Well, assuming you have correctly chosen the bitwise operator, you would have to find the bitwise operator which does its reverse. This can serve as
           		a hint to determine which bitwise operator to initially use. Next, simply add user input to the program to fully customize it, then you have a fully
           		functioning encryption and decryption program! The image on the right is an example output I coded. You may use this as a reference when compiling your
           		program.</p>
