           		<p name = "paragraph">This was a project I coded back in high school and is still the project I'm most proud of until today. In this game, I applied
           		my knowledge of physics and object oriented programming in Java and took me a total of three weeks to complete. This was the most fun I've had
           		coding and the most committed I was in a project. This project alone was what made me want to study Computer Science. To any student interested in
           		Computer Science I would highly recommend you try implenting this project. Or even if you are an experienced Computer Science student, attempting
           		to create a game in itself can test your physics and object oriented programming knowledge and be fun at the same time!</p>
           		
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">To beginners, I recommend you download the software called Greenfoot online. It is a beginner programming IDE 
           		which helps you understand Java and object oriented programming in a easy comprehensible way. With this IDE, you will be able to easily create
           		classes and understand the "parent" and "child" topics taught in object oriented programming. In addition, if you have any questions, be sure
           		to ask them on the Greenfoot forum! When I struggled with my project, I had many people help me fix my problems. Think of it like stack exchange!
           		In fact, if you dig deep enough, you can still find the questions I asked through the forum.</p>
