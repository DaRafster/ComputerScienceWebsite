           		<p name = "paragraph">The topic "loop unrolling" was something I learned fairly recently and a topic which I found pretty interesting.
           		This is a simple project which takes small effort but helps you develop some coding habits which can prove useful in the future.
           		For this project, all your are required to do is to create 3 types of loops, a for loop, a while loop, and a do-while loop. Each loop
           		will have one line of code in their body such as adding to a variable. Next, replicate those 3 loops, except do more than one iteration in the new loop. 
           		For example, one loop in the the previous loop would do sum = sum + 1. But in the new loop, you would do sum = sum + 1 + sum + 2 + sum + 3 which 
           		would be three iterations in a single loop. Adjust the variable incrementer accordingly as well.</p>
           		
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">Using libraries, measure how long the new loops execute compared to the old loops. You should see the new loops have 
           		a significant increase in execution time. This is the topic known as "loop unrolling". In the image on the right, I used an online compiler which 
           		converts C code into assembly(x86-64). In the assembly code, you should see instructions called "jmp". These refer to jumps in code such as if statements
           		or loops. The less jumps your code has, the more efficient your code will be. Compilers like executing instructions in sequential order rather than
           		jumping all over the place. With this simple project, you'll be able to develop a better understanding of machine code, so I highly encourage you try it!</p>
