           		familiar with Greenfoot, I recommend you check out my Space Rush project included in the Projects page for a brief summary of the beginner
           		IDE. The project took me a total of two weeks to complete and was a fun project to code. You will need to apply Physics to the game since
           		Mario like to jump a lot meaning you will have to take account for gravity and other factors.</p>
           		
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">Game development is a fun topic to get into, if you are just starting out, I highly recommend you try and
           		implement your own Mario game. You can create your own enemies, create different levels, and even add of your own favorite feautres. One 
           		feature I did not get to add was Mario's "Giant" powerup where he would take in a mushroom and grow in size. So, if you were to create a 
           		Mario game, I recommend you implement this feature. You can see what my project looked like with the video on the right.</p>
