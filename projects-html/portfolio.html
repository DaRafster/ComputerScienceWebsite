           		Employers recognize we are suitable for certain jobs based on our projects or achievements we have accomplished over
           		our time in school. For this reason, it would be an excellent idea to gather all your projects and experiences you've 
           		slowly built over the years into a portfolio website. Creating a portfolio website is one of the best ways to showcase
	 			your work and give others a solid impression of your personality, experiences and capabilities in your field.</p>
           		
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">The image to the right was actually a recent project I worked on early November as an assignment
           		of mine. I created a portfolio website which I used to showcase my work, hobbies, and skills. In a sense, the website you currently
           		are on is an improved version of my portfolio website except it's not only tailored towards potential employers, but to students as well!
				By showcasing my projects to other students through this website, I hope to inspire others to also code similar projects to mine as 
           		a challenge, or to even inspire new projects ideas similar to what I mention.
