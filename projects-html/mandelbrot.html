           		<p name = "paragraph">This project was the largest group project I had been apart of. The project took a total of two weeks to complete, so if
           		you are to attempt this, be aware it may take long if you work on this alone. Although, do not let this discourage you as this project is very
           		rewarding when it comes to testing your C++ knowledge! In this project, using object oriented programming, you would have to create a class
           		called Pixels which would represent a pixel. This whole project revolves around manipulating pixels with mathematical formulas to generate the
           		desired animated image like you see on the right.</p>
           		
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">Next, you would have to create a separate class called Mandelbrot which utilizes these pixels with mathematical 
           		formulas. It will also be a good idea to create a class called Complex for complex numbers as you will be using them in the formulas. You can find
           		the formulas online through a simple Google search for Mandebrot fractals. And as for guidance, I highly reccommend you look at some psuedocode 
           		which is available on Wikipedia when it comes to applying these formulas. I've essentially said everything that needs to be done in the code, but 
           		if you need a better understading of the project, I recommend you look at other resources available online.</p>
