           		as the experience in my Sophomore year so far has differed a little from my freshman year. First off, the course difficulty struck up another level,
           		I am currently struggling in Calculus II but I it looks like I will pull through in the end. However, the computer science courses are what 
           		surprised me the most. Currently, I am taking Computer Architeciture which is a very theoretical heavy course which is not one of my strong suits.</p>
           		
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">So, my advice so far to Computer Science students is too never take a Computer Science course lightly even if you 
           		are confident in your coding abilities. That is what happened to me. Although I am stil doing fine when it comes to grades, I definitely could have
           		done better if I had focused and dedicated more time to these courses at the beginning of the semester.</p>
