           		<h1>Freshman <span>Year</span></h1>
           		<p name = "paragraph">My first year of college was quite honestly, not too different from high school. At Douglas College, the classrooms
           		are very similar to high school classrooms, so the classroom settings did not require me to adjust to them. However, the course difficulty
           		definitely shot up a notch. Again, I must mention, if you are still in high school and plan to study Computer Science in college, focus on
           		your math and sciences as I was definitely struggling in the courses despite studying for them almost everyday. The likely cause to my struggle
           		is most likely because I did not take Pre-Calculus 11 seriously enough for myself to do well enough in Calculus. 
           		
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">One course that will undoubtedly give you some trouble in College as a Computer Science student is Discrete Math.
           		Your Calculus knowledge will not necessarily help you in this course. When you think of "Math", you think of numbers, trignometry, graphs. However,
           		when you take Discrete Math, most of that will not help you. So, when you take this course as it is a requirement for all Computer Science students
           		to learn, be sure to study well. The course is full of theorems and proofs and a lot of theoretical knowledge, so taking in everything in this
           		course can be difficult as not everybody is well versed in theory.</p>
           		
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">When it came to the programming courses, they were surprisingly easy because I had taken a lot of Computer Science
           		related courses in high school, allowing me to get a head start compared to the students who have no programming experience. So, taking programming
           		courses, even if post-secondaries do not consider them as pre-requisites, taking programming courses in high school is still very rewarding. Other than
           		that, you will find the first year of College not as difficult as you imagined it was in high school but it undoubtedly gets harder as the semesters
           		go on as you will continue to take more advanced courses as you progress.</p>
