           		<h1>Choosing a <span>College</span></h1>
           		<p name = "paragraph">Choosing a college was most definitely one of the most anxiety inducing experiences I have had. I applied to SFU and UBC
           		in early November in Grade 12. However, since I was not confident in my ability to get into these universities, I needed other backups as well.
           		In mid November, I ended up applying to BCIT's CST Program, Douglas College, and Langara's Computing Science programs. If you are a student 
           		looking for a college but not confident in your abilities to get into a more prestigious university such as UBC or SFU, be sure to apply to other
           		colleges which offer transfer programs to your desired schools.
           		
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">One certain advice I can give to aspiring Computer Science students is to apply early. Many of my classmates
           		and friends ended up having good enough grades to get into the university but got waitlisted due to the excessive amount of applications the
           		universities have received. Even I got waitlisted for BCIT but ended up lucky and got a spot in the program. Sadly, as I was expecting, in
           		January, I ended up getting rejected by SFU and UBC. The main reason was obvious as my Grade 11 grades were fairly subpar. However, lucky enough
        		I got accepted into Douglas, Langara, and BCIT giving me three solid options to pursue my career in Computer Science.</p>
           		
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">I ended up choosing Douglas College as my school. Douglas College had a nice two year program which allows you
           		to transfer to SFU or UBC provided you have maintained a well enough GPA and had a much cheaper tuition fee for the first two years. Langara was
           		also a solid choice but I ended up choosing Douglas due to locality. BCIT was a legitimate option I could have taken which was a two year program,
           		but due to how heavy the courseload is, I ended up choosing Douglas College. </p>
           		
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">Although I did not get into my desired schools right away, I was actually glad I got rejected. You can save a lot of
           		money going to a transfer college first such as Douglas or Langara. In addition, teachers are much more hands-on when it comes to their students. In
           		universities, proffessors usually have too many students to even bother memorizing their names. At Douglas, I can go to a professor's office hours and
           		get the help I need right away or even send an email and receive a reply back within a couple hours. If I had done these things at SFU or UBC, I probably
           		would not have gotten the help I needed right away.</p>
           		
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">If you are an aspiring Computer Science student here in Canada and want to get into SFU or UBC, I actually recommend
           		going to Douglas or Langara for your first two years. You can save a lot of money doing so and receive much more help when it comes to proffessors.
           		So, what I would take away from my experience is to not be discouraged if you did not get into your desired univerisity, attend Douglas or Langara where
           		you have much more opportunities to learn and save money. Maintain your grades in college and you will have an easier time getting into your desired 
           		university compared to going there straight from high school.</p>
