           		<p name = "paragraph">If you are still in high school and you are considering taking Computer Science in college, keep reading. Learning from my 
           		mistakes can help you be in a better position then I was initially. Back in high school, I wish I had done many things differently. I did not take 
           		Grade 11 seriously enough first of all. This was my biggest regret. I still achieved fairly good marks and ended up with an above 80% average, 
           		however, I did not take my Math and Sciences seriously enough for myself to be satisfied with my results during graduation.</p>
           		
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">Your grade 11 and 12 grades are what determines which college you get into. Back then, I did not do enough research
           		to recognize this was the case which resulted in myself getting average grades in high school. In BC, the most recognized universities for 
           		Computer Science is most notably Simon Fraser University and the University of British Columbia. Achieving average grades gives you a shot at these
           		universities but does not guarantee you admission.</p>
           		
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">Grade 12 is when I started to take high school more seriously after finding out my chances at both SFU and UBC were not 
           		the greatest. I started to take my Sciences and Math much more seriously. Looking back, I was glad I started to take these subjects seriously as
           		they still are the subject I still struggle on the most in college. So if you are still in high school, I highly recommend you focus on your 
           		math and sciences as they will help you immensely studying Computer Science in college.</p>
           		
           		<p name = "paragraph" id = "p1">Besides from those regrets and mistakes I had just mentioned, there were still many things I was proud of in high school
           		which I believe any aspiring Computer Science student should do as well. Many students go into college without any programming experience, but I started 
           		out early by taking Computer Programming 11 & 12, and even took AP Computer Science in grade 12, allowing me to get early credits in college since I 
           		did well enough on the exam. As a result from myself doing well in Computer Science related courses, I managed to get a scholarship which allowed be to
           		pay for my tuition in my first year in college.</p>
